Layers
  layer[datastructures] = visual representation of a geographical dataset in any
    digital map environment. slice / stratum of the geographical reality in a particular area.
    equivalent to a legend item on a paper map.
  
  layer[ERSI software] = reference to a datasource that defines how the data should be 
    symbolized on a map.

  dir() = python function shows you all available methods for any object
  
# to access the attribute of each feature in a layer use: 
for f in layer.getFeatures():
  print f['name'], f['iata_code']
 
     
geometry() = coordinates of a vector feature can be accessed through this function.
    returns a geometry object that can store in the variable geom.
  
asPoint() = run it on the geometry object to get the x and y coordinates of 
    points
  
asPolyline() , asPolygon()  if feature is a line or polygon

# to get the coordinates of each feature use: 
for f in layer.getFeatures():
  geom = f.geometry()
  print geom.asPoint()

x() = to only get the x coordinate

for f in layer.getFeatures():
  geom = f.geometry()
  print geom.asPoint().x()
