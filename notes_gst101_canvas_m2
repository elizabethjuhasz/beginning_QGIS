//understanding geospatial data models//

The objects stores the geometry of the spatial phenomenon.
Attributes store descriptive information.

A text data type cannot be used for mathematical calculations.

Discrete spatial phenomenon are like roads and lakes.
Continuous spatial phenomenon--elevation

Vector data model defines discrete objects. Has an associated attribute table. 
  three basic points:  lines, points, and polygons
      composed of coordinates and attributes
     line must always start and end with a node and may have any number of vertices between the two nodes. 
      

Lines
  Node and vertex
  Node: where a line begins and ends
  vertex: where a line changes direction

Triangular Irregular Network (TIN)
  anatomy:  point, edge, face
  represents continuous objects, like a raster
